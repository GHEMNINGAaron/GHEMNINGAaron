# 🦁 GHEMNING Aaron

**`A passionate software engineer`** 

## About Me
### Passionate about software architecture & distributed systems
- I design clear, scalable, and elegant architectures, with a strong focus on distributed and cloud-ready systems that can handle real-world scale and complexity.

### Creator of everyday solutions
- I love turning real-life problems into simple, effective tools — most of my software comes from concrete needs and makes daily life smoother.

### Creative & community-driven
- Between photography and tech projects, I enjoy creating, documenting, and sharing what I learn to inspire and support the developer community.
